# Overview

This is mainly a simple calculator I made in C++ to start learning the language

I built a few things before thecalculator one of them being a simple test program to learn loops, switches, and variables and
then moved on to the claculator using all I had learned from the test programs as well as adding more things like learning the Cmath library


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software 
running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used VS code and git to code this project.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
<iostream> - to handle basic input output
<string> - to handle basic strings as c++ doesnt handel them by default
<cmath> - to allow me to use more complex mathmatical functions
<typeinfo> - used compare types of variables

# Future Work
- more error handleing
- add more logarithmic functions
- give it the ability to handle more complex equations
- give it a GUI
